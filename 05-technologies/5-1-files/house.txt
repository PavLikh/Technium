I live in a small house. It has two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. My bedroom is very cozy. I have a bed, a desk, and a small bookshelf. The kitchen is where we cook our meals. It has a big refrigerator and a stove. The living room is very comfortable, with a big sofa and a TV. I love my house because it is small but very nice.
